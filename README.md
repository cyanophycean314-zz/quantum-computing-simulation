# quantum-computing-simulation

Kevin's summer project to build a classical simulator for quantum computers to try and learn about everything.

Approximate agenda

Qbit representation - Done! 
Quantum gates
	- unary - Done!
	- binary - Done!
	- arbitrary - Done!
Implement Deutsch Jonza Algorithm - Done!
	  - Can run on 10 qbits with runtime 2.864s. As expected, runtime increases exponentially
Action on qbits by Hamiltonians
Adiabatic simulation
Approximate Optimization
MPS
